The website, being a game shop was made in order to attract attention of potential buyers who land on the website. The first thing we see on the website is a carousel of all the games availale in the shop. The carousel changes images in quick intervals in order to attract attention and also show more games to the buyers. After that, there is a brief introduction about the shop followed by all the games available along with their genres and platforms it supports.
The contact page is a simple page including details like address, contact information,etc. there is also a form to directly contact the shop for queries.

The technologies used in the website are HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, React.js.

Bootstrap was used for making the website responsive as it takes away a large chunk of work needed for the task.

I avoid coding repeatative things:
1. Reusing navigation bar component on both pages.
2. Creating an array of all the data(game data), than mapped it on the component instead of creating the same component with diffrent data multiple times. 
3. React was used to make the website more snappier and feel more appealing.
